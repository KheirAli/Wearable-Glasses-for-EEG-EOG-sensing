## 1. Circuit Design

Our circuit design focuses on amplifying and filtering the low-amplitude EEG and EOG signals. The schematic shows how the AD623 instrumentation amplifier, Sallen-Key filters, and other conditioning circuits are connected.

## 3. EEG Alpha Wave Analysis

To evaluate our EEG circuit, we measured the alpha wave power when the subjectâ€™s eyes were closed versus open. The first image displays the measured alpha wave power, while the second image shows the spectrogram highlighting the frequency distribution.

## 4. EOG Blink Detection

The EOG module captures the blink events by amplifying the bioelectric signals produced by the eyelid muscles. The designated image displays the blink detection graph, where distinct spikes correspond to individual blinks.
